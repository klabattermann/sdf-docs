[Contact us](contact-us.md) if you need resources for running
long-lived jobs such as websites, web applications, or
real-time/fast-feedback systems.

## S3DF Dynamic Sites and Web Applications

S3DF is currently supporting websites and web applications for several groups,
programs, and experiments:

| Site/Application	| URL |
| :--- | :--- |
| USDF Rubin Science Platform (RSP) | https://usdf-rsp.slac.stanford.edu|
| LCLS | https://pswww.slac.stanford.edu|
| SuperCDMS | https://supercdms-dev.slac.stanford.edu|
| Cryo-EM E-Logbook | https://cryoem-logbook.slac.stanford.edu|

Dynamic content refers to a website or web application that is
typically generated on a per-client basis with information on how to
render the site fetched from a database or other server-side
resource. A dynamic site or application may also provide some method
of authentication for user logins, saved preferences, and other
functionality.

S3DF supports web applications deployed as
[containerized](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/)
workloads in Kubernetes. Please submit a request to migrate or deploy
containerized web applications in S3DF to
[s3df-help](mailto:s3df-help@slac.stanford.edu). We will allocate a
K8s virtual cluster for you and a DNS entry for your top-level
site. You will then be able to manage your own web applications within
the cluster. Eventually, the default naming scheme will be:

`https://<facilityname>.sdf.slac.stanford.edu/<webappname>`

?> The URL above assumes S3DF own its own subdomain, which is not
currently the case. For the time being, we'll work with you to find a
temporary URL without .sdf in the name.

## S3DF Static Sites

S3DF can make static content from specific directories publicly
available via HTTP. Static content refers to static HTML pages or
files that are served directly to the users as-is. This may include
(but is not limited to) image files, HTML/JavaScript files, and CSS
files, that a user can view or download directly by going to the site
via a browser. If you need this service, please contact
[s3df-help](mailto:s3df-help@slac.stanford.edu). If you are the Point
of Contact (PoC) for an S3DF facility, you may request this service on
behalf of your organization or group.

Hosted files or directories must be located under the appropriate user
or group `public_html` directory. This table shows the mapping between
the hosted S3DF filesystem locations and the public URLs to access
their contents:

| S3DF Host Path | URL |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/sdf/home/<u>/<username>/public_html` | https://s3df.slac.stanford.edu/people/&lt;username&gt;|
| `/sdf/data/<groupname>/public_html` | https://s3df.slac.stanford.edu/data/&lt;groupname&gt; |


?> Publicly accessible content hosted in S3DF is subject to the [SLAC
Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources
Policy](https://slac.sharepoint.com/sites/SLACPolicies/Shared%20Documents/SLAC-only%20Policies/IT-057-Acceptable%20Use%20of%20Information%20Technology%20Resources.pdf).

?> In the future, requests for static web content hosting will be
managed via the S3DF [Coact](https://s3df.slac.stanford.edu/coact)
portal.

?> The `.htaccess` mechanism for `public_html` subdirectory configuration
and access is not allowed. S3DF does support password-protected access
using Basic Authentication but only for group space. Please have the
facility/group PoC contact
[s3df-help](mailto:s3df-help@slac.stanford.edu) to enable
password-protected access for those subdirectories.

?> Symlinks to locations not under `public_html` , either on the S3DF
filesystem or other network filesystems (e.g., SLAC AFS, SLAC GPFS,
SDF Lustre, etc.), are not allowed and such links will not resolve
when accessed via HTTP.

## S3DF Cron Tasks
A dedicated cron node is provided for managing scheduled cron tasks.

To access the cron node:
1. Log in to S3DF as normal.
2. From the S3DF node, connect via SSH to `sdfcron001`.
3. Use the `crontab` command as normal to manage cronjobs.

?> User cronjobs will be enabled only for this cron node.

Since interactive user connections are distributed between nodes in the S3DF environment and cron configurations are not shared between nodes, using the dedicated cron server will simplify the maangement of user cronjobs.
