**Lustre Filesystem Storage Issue**

**UPDATE Tuesday February 20th 9:00PM PST: DDN support recommended a filesystem check which has completed. 81 disks have now completed 90% of their rebuilds. A smaller group of 9 disks are also awaiting rebuilds but we expect they will progress faster. All OSTs have remained online since early Friday morning.**
