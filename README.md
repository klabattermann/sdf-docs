!> **AS OF SATURDAY FEBRUARY 10TH 12:00PM PST:** The S3DF team worked all night and is closer to getting the storage system back to production status.  There were multiple items to be addressed, and the task list is nearing completion.  We will post another update at 3:00PM PST.  Thank you for your patience.

Welcome to the SLAC Shared Scientific Data Facility (S3DF). The S3DF
is a compute, storage and network architecture designed to support
massive scale analytics required by all SLAC experimental facilities
and programs, including LCLS/LCLS-II, UED, cryo-EM, the accelerator,
and the Rubin observatory. The S3DF infrastructure is optimized for
data analytics and is characterized by large, massive throughput, high
concurrency storage systems.
